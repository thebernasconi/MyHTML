	<h1>This is My First Header</h1>

	<p>Now as the main text of this exercise I'm using the first paragraph of the book "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien. It goes as follows: "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.".</p>

	<h2>This is Now the Second Header</h2>

	<p>Now for the second paragraph of text IÂ´m adding the first paragraph of the first book of the Game of Thrones series by R.R. Martin. It goes as follows: "The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement.".</p>
